          <h4>Early Schooling</h4>
          <p>As a kid, I was jealous of kids who were in preschool. I was so eager to start school but had to wait until kindergarten. I woke up excited for school every morning through middle school. Middle school at <a href="http://bergencharter.org/">Bergen Arts &amp; Science Charter School</a> was one of the best educational experiences I've had. When starting there in 6th grade, I immediately felt the difference from conventional public school teaching geared towards following the book. At Bergen Charter, I was highly encouraged to join clubs that I was interested in. I tried everything from Theatre to Math Olympiad to Basketball. I ended up becoming very passionate about Robotics and Math at the age of 11. I competed in Robotics competitions in the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST LEGO League</a> and made it to the state level each year. For me, middle school was a pivotal time where I really learned about my passions all while still performing well on standardized state exams. Ultimately, attending a charter school where teachers cared more about students learning and finding their passions while also being able to prepare them for standardized state exams is what has led me to become such a strong supporter of charter schools.</p>
          <h4>High School</h4>
          <p>Starting high school was a challenging time for me. I'd gone from a small charter school with a lot of student emphasis to a much larger county-wide school taking only the brightest students in Bergen County. <a href="https://bcts.bergen.org/index.php/2016-05-10-17-30-50/bcts-campuses">Bergen County Academies</a> was beyond rigorous. My average day started at 6:15AM to catch the 7:00AM bus to school. Classes ended at 4:10PM and the bus didn't drop me back off until around 5:00PM. This was when I wasn't in season for Track &amp; Field. I took some awesome courses while there but the environment was highly competitive and from the day I started, there was a strong emphasis on getting into an elite university. High school was much more about performing well in class than it was about pursuing passions. This is when my stance on Elite American Education changed. High school was when the kid eager to start preschool became the kid hesitant to even going to college. I did nonetheless make the decision to attend college. It wasn't much of a decision considering it was the norm at my high school and a bare minimum expectation from my parents.</p>
          <h4>University</h4>
          <p>I moved into my dorm room at Tufts University in August 2015. By that point, I had changed my mentality to be more optimistic about college since I was going to be spending 4 years there anyhow. Though I was initially enrolled in the engineering school, it wasn't long before I decided to transfer into the school of Arts &amp; Science to pursue Economics. I learned that what I really loved about engineering was problem solving and that to me, the application of solving problems is a lot more interesting in business than it is in engineering. A couple semesters went by and I was really liking my classes but found that I wasn't really fitting in at the school in general. Here's a really interesting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">interactive article</a> by the New York Times that shares the socioeconomic composition of American universities. Sophomore year I decided that I should give myself options and try to transfer to a school where I could continue learning a lot while also being happier. I figured a place with more diversity would be ideal.</p>
          <p>Transferring was a challenging process in itself that started the winter break of my sophomore year. I sent out only a handful of applications so I could really focus on writing high quality essays. Thankfully, I got into Columbia - a school I hadn't even considered in high school but am now so grateful to be at. Starting college for the second time but this time as a junior was tough but in a very different way than starting for the first time. Classes have been more challenging but I've been able to connect with people a lot more and being in NYC has been really great. I'm definitely excited about the rest of my time here but also very glad that the culmination of my formal schooling is in sight. Though I can't wait to graduate and be done spending hours per week in a classroom, I'm also really looking forward to the tremendous amount of knowledge I have yet to gain outside the classroom.</p>
