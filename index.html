          <p>I was born and raised in a small town in Northern New Jersey called Wood-Ridge to a household of immigrant parents and an older sister who is now in medical school. Most of my time as a kid was spent playing outside in my backyard with my neighborhood friends. During my middle school years at <a href="http://bergencharter.org/">Bergen Arts &amp; Scinence Charter School</a> - a charter school in Garfield, NJ - I developed a passion for STEM. After graduating middle school, I attended a public magnet high school called <a href="https://bcts.bergen.org/index.php/2016-05-10-17-30-50/bcts-campuses">Bergen County Academies</a> where I took rigorous courses including many with an engineering focus. Upon graduation, I moved up to Medford, MA to pursue a degree in Environmental Engineering at Tufts University. After a little over a year there, I learned that it wasn't a great fit for me and explored my options, leading to my decision to transfer. Currently, I'm a junior at Columbia University studying Economics. <a href="/education">More on my Education</a></p>
          <p>My father started his own company specializing in manufacturing custom fragrances after spending years in the industry. I ofted worked for him throughout my high school years and developed a strong interest in entrepreneurship. Around the age of 15, after getting bored of tinkering around with the hardware I could find in my house, I decided to take on web development. I started with a small project in which I learned enough to take on a few gigs. My summer between Freshman and Sophomore years of college, I worked as a web developer for a non-profit in town where I grew my skills further. I still continue doing web gigs from time to time but have shifted my focus more narrowly on E-commerce. <a href="/websites">More about Web Dev</a></p>
          <p>I started my first business the summer before my senior year of high school using money I'd earned that summer as seed capital. After learning the foundations of laser cutting and engraving at school, I purchased my very own laser cutter &amp; engraver. I named the little business out of my garage <a href="ykgcustoms.github.io">YKG Custom Productions</a> and had a blast working with my customers while being my own boss. Before heading to college I had to sell the company but was determined to continue a path in entreprenership. Right before my sophomore year of college, I joined a venture with my cousin and his girlfriend called <a href="https://knottyknickers.co/">Knotty Knickers</a> - a subscription service for women's underwear. Though I am no longer involved with the company, I have continued exploring the E-commerce industry. This summer, I worked at a marketing agency and with my co-workers, started an online shop called <a href="https://needformybackyard.com/">Need For My Backyard</a> that performed quite well over the summer months. Since the end of the summer, I have been working on my biggest project yet. I am now the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://wiffbox.com/">WIFF</a> - a custom fragrance subscription service. <a href="/education">More on my Ventures</a></p>
